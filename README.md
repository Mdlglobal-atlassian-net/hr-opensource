## Welcome to hr-opensource!


This is intended to be an open forum for anyone to discuss HR related topics and ideas. Basically, we want to do with the HR Community on GitHub what software developers have been doing on GitHub since 2008: Build great work product in a collaborative way.  

This is open to HR professionals as well as non-HR professionals. We want to mix up the pot, both within the HR Community as well as outside of the HR Community. 

We want to share and de-mystify what HR does, as many people outside of HR don't know. We also want to help people within HR learn and iterate on their work rapidly and collaborate to accelerate their teams and their organizations, which is really the end goal anyway, right? 

Let's try to shake this up a bit and change the landscape of HR and how we work!
